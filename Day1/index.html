      <h1>Una Roberts</h1>
      <p>My name is Ãšna Roberts and I am currently a freshman at Columbia College Chicago. I am pursuing a degree in animation with a minor in programming. I have been doing art since I was very young, with a primary focus on drawing, traditional and digital, and painting and some experience with block prints, sculpture and collage. I use art as a medium to express myself. Most of my art focuses on aspects of my identity or social issues relevant to me. I often like to capture moments and people in my art- moments in mine or other people's lives, or the essence of what makes someone who they are. I want my pieces to provoke thought in those who see them- maybe they relate to what the piece is about or maybe it offers a new perspective to them. Pieces that tell a story are my favorite kind of art, so I try to corporate a story or background into each of my pieces. Through my art I have been able to more clearly establish who I am and what my values as a person are. I want to develop a more distinctive personal style and further my understanding of the fundamentals of art. I hope to continue to work in a variety of mediums, hopefully including some new ones. I think art can have a huge impact on people's lives and I hope to learn how to make that kind of art.
